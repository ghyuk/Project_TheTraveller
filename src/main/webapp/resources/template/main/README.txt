Site, where i saw the original concept, uses canvas for page transitions :D And because i'm a newbie with canvas, i made more simplistic (in terms of animation, not code) copy with margin transitions (transform not working with background-attachment: fixed, which is needed for separated blocks with background-size: cover).
Tested in latest Chrome/FF/IE, everywhere works ok.
Original and really awesome site - http://grouek.com/
May have some z-index problems with shaking/disappearing blocks.
